# PACMEN PROJECT

## What's this project about?
This project is about creating a game of a pacman that moves and tries to eat at different speeds, depending of a on event click, that means that whenever the users clicks on the pacmen, it will change the velocity of its movements, both of the mouth and of its position in the web page window. This is a dynamic activity that gets advantage of the skills in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## How to Run: 
- Get sure you download three files:
   ·  index.html
   ·  pacmen.js
   ·  images/pacman1
   ·  images/pacman2
   ·  images/pacman3
   ·  images/pacman4
- The javascript file is already inserted in the html file, and the two files plus the four images must be saved in the same directory, always check it is done like this.
- Load "index.html" file in the web browser.
- Click on the pacmen and have fun!
  
## What's next?
What I plan to work on next in this repository is to play with the pacmen position in different directions and see it also can change its color according to its position in the window or its velocity.
